2. Extend the lexical Analyzer to Check comments, dened as follows in C: a) A comment begins with // and includes all characters until the end of that line. b) A comment begins with /* and includes all characters through the next occurrence of the character sequence */Develop a lexical Analyzer to identify whether a given line is a comment or not

Program:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void checkComment(char *line) {
    if (strncmp(line, "//", 2) == 0)
        printf("Single-line comment detected.\n");
    else if (strncmp(line, "/*", 2) == 0 && strstr(line, "*/") != NULL)
        printf("Multi-line comment detected.\n");
    else
        printf("Not a comment.\n");
}

int main() {
    char line[100];
    printf("Enter a line of code: ");
    fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);

    checkComment(line);
    return 0;
}
